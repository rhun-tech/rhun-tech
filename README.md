Greetings!

I'm @rhun-tech, a passionate developer exploring the realms of software engineering and game development. Here's a bit about what I've been up to:

- Rhun Quest: I'm currently crafting an immersive choose-your-own-adventure story called Rhun Quest. It's a journey filled with challenges, magic, and deep narratives. Technically speaking, it's a Blazor server application leverging Fluent UI components and a minimal API for data retrieval. Did I mention I am using GitHub Actions? All too cool. Join me as we explore this epic tale together!

  - [Rhun Quest API](https://rhunquestapi.azurewebsites.net/)
  
- Static Website: I have a static website that showcases my projects and interests. Currently considering migrating it to Azure Storage Account static websites for cost reasons.

- Object-Oriented Programming Examples: I enjoy creating simple yet effective examples to illustrate the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). You'll find snippets and projects here that demonstrate various OOP principles and patterns.
